Containerization (Docker Compose & Future Kubernetes): All components of Autolink – the React Native app (web), the Express API, the PostgreSQL database, and any future services (like a standalone auth service) – are containerized using Docker. In development and early deployments, we use Docker Compose to orchestrate these containers. Docker Compose allows us to define multi-container setups (for example, one service for the API, one for the DB, one for perhaps a proxy) in a single YAML file, making it easy to spin up the entire stack with one command. Each service is defined with its image, environment variables, volumes, and network, so that the API can talk to the DB container internally (e.g., using the service name as hostname).

By containerizing each part, we ensure environment consistency: the app runs the same way on any machine that has Docker. This eliminates the “works on my machine” problem and simplifies dependency management. The containers encapsulate the Node.js runtime, the Postgres instance, etc., so developers and CI/CD pipelines all run identical environments.

Our design is cloud-agnostic and ready for Kubernetes. While initially we might deploy on a single VM with Docker Compose, the eventual goal is to move to a Kubernetes cluster for better scalability and resilience. Each Docker image we create (for the API, for example) can be deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment, and the database as a StatefulSet or managed DB service. The stateless nature of the API and the use of environment vars for configuration align well with Kubernetes principles. We also keep container images lean (using slim Node base images, etc.) to speed up deployments and reduce resource usage.

When transitioning to Kubernetes, we plan to use infrastructure-as-code (possibly Terraform or Helm charts) to define the K8s resources, which ensures consistency across environments and easy cloud provider portability. In a Kubernetes environment, we can leverage features like horizontal pod autoscalers (to scale API pods based on load) and managed services for the database (or run Postgres in a cluster with persistence). By keeping our architecture loosely coupled (e.g., the app doesn’t assume it’s talking to a local DB, only that the DB connection string is provided), we can deploy on any cloud or on-premises.

CI/CD Strategy: We recommend setting up a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying Autolink. Using a cloud-agnostic CI tool is key for flexibility – for instance, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins can be configured to work with any cloud provider or on-prem server ￼. Our CI pipeline will run on each commit or on each merge to the main branch. The typical stages include:
	1.	Build – Lint and compile the front-end (ensuring the React Native app builds for web and that TypeScript has no errors) and build the Node.js API (run tests, etc.). We also build the Docker images for the API and possibly a web bundle image if deploying the web app containerized.
	2.	Test – Run automated tests (unit tests for API, possibly some integration tests hitting a test DB, and basic front-end tests). We aim to keep a good test coverage so that we catch issues early. This stage ensures that no breaking changes are deployed.
	3.	Deploy – Using Docker, push the new images to a container registry (like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry). Then, using either Docker Compose on the server or kubectl (if on Kubernetes), we deploy the new version. In a Compose setup, this might be an SSH command to pull the new images and restart containers. In Kubernetes, we’d update the Deployment images which triggers a rolling update.

The CI/CD should be as automated as possible: for example, a push to the main or release branch triggers a deployment to a staging environment, and with approval, to production. We can integrate infrastructure as code in the pipeline as well – e.g., using Terraform to ensure the infrastructure (like a database instance, or a Kubernetes cluster) is up-to-date.

Because we want to be cloud agnostic, we avoid using a CI/CD service that’s tied to a specific cloud’s tooling (like we wouldn’t rely solely on AWS CodePipeline). Instead, using GitHub Actions or Jenkins ensures we can deploy to AWS, Azure, GCP, or a private server with the same pipeline ￼. The pipeline will use Docker and kubectl, which are universal. We also store configuration (like secrets for DB or API keys) in secure CI env vars or secret managers rather than hardcoding anything, so migrating between environments is straightforward.

In the future, we might incorporate more advanced deployment strategies: for example, blue-green deployments or canary releases on Kubernetes (where we spin up new version pods and gradually shift traffic). We also plan to include automated security checks (like dependency vulnerability scans) and performance tests in the CI process as the project grows.

Cloud Agnostic Approach: We deliberately choose technologies and workflows that do not lock us into a single cloud provider. Docker and Kubernetes are key to this – they abstract away the underlying server specifics. We can run our Docker containers on any platform that supports Docker (which is basically everywhere). For cloud services like databases, if we use managed Postgres, we would use solutions available on multiple clouds (AWS RDS, Azure Postgres, GCP Cloud SQL are all similar, or we run Postgres ourselves in a VM or K8s). By using Terraform (which supports all major clouds) to script our infrastructure, we can deploy the same stack on AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean with minor adjustments.

We avoid proprietary services that are unique to one cloud unless they have clear equivalents on others and we encapsulate their use. For instance, instead of using AWS Lambda + DynamoDB (which ties us to AWS), our Node/Express container and Postgres can run anywhere. If we do use any cloud-specific feature (say AWS S3 for file storage in the future), we will abstract it behind an interface so we could switch to Google Cloud Storage or local storage as needed.

Logging and monitoring solutions will also be chosen with portability in mind – e.g., using open-source stacks (ELK, Prometheus/Grafana) or SaaS that support multi-cloud.

Our deployment scripts rely on generic tools (Docker, kubectl, Helm) that are cloud-agnostic. As a result, hosting Autolink on AWS ECS, or on an Azure AKS cluster, or on a local Kubernetes is just a matter of configuration. This cloud-agnostic design means we maintain the freedom to choose or change providers based on cost, client requirements, or other factors without significant refactoring.

To summarize, Docker Compose gives us quick multi-container setup now, and our adherence to containerization and 12-factor principles paves the way for Kubernetes deployment. Our CI/CD is designed to be flexible and automated, using common tools to remain cloud-provider neutral ￼ ￼. This ensures that Autolink’s infrastructure is portable, scalable, and maintainable in the long run.
