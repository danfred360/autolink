Security is woven into every layer of Autolink’s architecture. This section highlights the key security best practices we follow across the stack to protect user data and ensure system integrity.

Authentication & OAuth 2.0: We use industry-standard authentication practices so that user identities and credentials are secure. As described, the API uses JWTs for stateless auth. This is aligned with OAuth 2.0 bearer token usage, meaning our tokens can be treated as OAuth access tokens in the Authorization header. In the future, when integrating a full OAuth2 provider (like Keycloak or another OpenID Connect server), the transition will be smooth. OAuth 2.0 allows for robust security, enabling features like scoped access (limiting what a token can do) and third-party delegation (if we ever expose APIs for external integration) ￼. All passwords are hashed using strong algorithms, and we will enforce HTTPS so that login credentials and tokens are never sent over plaintext. We plan to implement refresh tokens with care – storing them http-only and secure on web, or in secure storage on mobile, to prevent XSS or malware from stealing them. By keeping token lifetimes short and using refresh tokens, we limit the window of misuse if an access token is compromised ￼.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): As mentioned, RBAC is used to ensure users can only perform actions allowed for their role. The principle of least privilege is followed strictly – each user or service gets the minimum permissions necessary ￼. For example, a normal user’s token cannot delete cars other than their own, and even an admin token would not be used for day-to-day app usage. Internally, we might also separate roles/permissions further (for instance, if we have a maintenance shop user vs a car owner user in the future). The architecture can accommodate an authorization service or middleware that checks permissions based on roles and possibly attributes (ABAC) for more complex rules later on. All such checks are centralized in the API layer, so they can be audited and updated easily.

Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection: We implement rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate brute force login attempts and denial-of-service abuse ￼ ￼. This ensures no single client can flood the system. In addition, we could implement account lockout policies on the auth endpoints (e.g., temporarily lock a user after 5 failed login attempts) to prevent password guessing attacks. Using an API gateway or a web application firewall (WAF) in front of our services is also considered for production – these can provide IP blocking, bot detection, and additional throttling. Since we plan for Kubernetes, we can also leverage an Ingress controller with rate-limit features or a service mesh for some of these controls.

API Gateway Considerations: Once we have multiple microservices (for instance, a separate auth service, maybe a separate analytics service, etc.), using an API Gateway becomes important for a unified entry point. The gateway can handle routing (directing auth requests to the auth service, data requests to the API service), and can enforce authentication globally. We’ve kept our design compatible with this: for example, our services expect JWTs and could accept validation from a gateway. The gateway could also offload SSL termination and certificate management. For now, in Docker Compose, we might use Nginx as a reverse proxy to simulate this role (it can forward /api to Express, etc., and handle HTTPS).

Data Protection (at rest and in transit): Protecting sensitive data is critical. All network traffic containing user data (between app and API, and API to database) is encrypted. We will use HTTPS for app-to-API, and within our Docker environment or Kubernetes cluster, network traffic is not exposed to the public. Optionally, we can enforce SSL between services as well (in Kubernetes this can be done with mTLS in a service mesh if needed, though in a contained network it’s less of an issue). For data at rest, our PostgreSQL database will have its storage volume encrypted (many cloud providers do this by default, and Linux disk encryption can be used on a server). The user passwords are stored as one-way hashes (bcrypt with salt), and any other particularly sensitive information (for example, if we store API keys, or personal user info like a home address in the future) can be additionally encrypted at the application level. We also minimize data retention – we store only what is needed for the app’s functionality and nothing more.

Regular backups of the database will be performed (automated if using a managed DB, or via cron job dumps if self-hosted) and those backups themselves will be encrypted. Access to the database and backups is restricted to administrators.

Within the app, we are careful about data exposure. The API only returns necessary fields to the client (e.g., when a user fetches their profile, we send their name and email but never their password hash of course). This follows the principle of not exposing sensitive data unnecessarily ￼. In logs, we also sanitize sensitive info – tokens or passwords won’t be logged.

Preventing Common Vulnerabilities: We follow OWASP best practices to guard against common web and mobile vulnerabilities. Input validation is in place to prevent SQL injection or malformed data. By using ORMs or parameterized queries, we ensure queries are safe ￼. We also sanitize outputs to avoid XSS; although our app is native/mobile (so XSS is mainly a web concern for the web build), we ensure that any dynamically generated HTML (if any in web version) is properly escaped. Using Helmet in Express adds headers like Content-Security-Policy and XSS-Protection to help on the web side. We protect against CSRF by not relying on cookies for auth (we use JWT in header, and for web if we use http-only cookie for refresh token, we will pair it with same-site attributes or anti-CSRF tokens as needed). The mobile app is less susceptible to CSRF since it’s not browser-based, but if we have a web client, we’ll address it.

On the mobile app side, we ensure the storage of tokens uses secure storage (Expo SecureStore or similar) so that other apps or a jailbroken phone can’t easily steal them. We’ll also consider certificate pinning in the app for API calls to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks, especially because users might be on untrusted networks.

Security Monitoring and Updates: We will monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities (using tools like npm audit or GitHub Dependabot). The Docker base images will be kept updated to get security patches. Any critical security updates in Node, Postgres, or our dependencies will trigger a new deployment. Logging and monitoring are set up so that we can detect unusual activities – for example, spikes in requests, repeated failed logins, etc., can be flagged for review. In production, integrating an APM/security monitoring service (like Datadog, Sentry, or an ELK stack) will help alert us to potential issues.

In conclusion, our architecture is built with a defense-in-depth approach: robust authentication and authorization, network security (HTTPS, rate limiting), secure coding practices, and planning for secure infrastructure ￼. By following OAuth 2.0 standards, implementing RBAC, protecting data, and remaining vigilant with updates, we ensure that Autolink’s user data and services remain safe. Security is not a one-time setup but an ongoing process – our design allows for evolving and strengthening security measures as new threats emerge or the system grows in complexity. Every new feature will be reviewed with security in mind so that Autolink remains a trustworthy platform for managing automobile records.
